Cataloger's Macros for Notepad++

These macros were created for Notepad++ and are intended for use in formatting OCRd text into MARC for OCLC Connexion.

ByToBy is a simple find and replace that changes "By" to "by." Very simple, but reduces the need for typing. Works well with 

FirstSubfield adds a $t to the beginning of the selected paragraph.

ToCFormat formats plain text, non-enhanced table of contents fields into MARC formatting. Text must be formatted using -- between chapters and / between a chapter and its statement of responsibility where applicable. The macro cannot discern the difference between a chapter and a part, so subfield $g will need to be added manually.
